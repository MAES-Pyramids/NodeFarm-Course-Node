# NodeFarm-Course-Node
### Node-Farm is my first small project to create a node server used to simulate  simple routing technique used between different pages in the site.
#### this server is implemented using some common node and npm packages like:
 - HTTP package
 - URL package
 - slugify package

### You can access **Node-Farm** hosted version on Git-Hup active codespace from [Here](https://maes-pyramids-curly-space-lamp-rv56wgqqppw3w54v-8080.preview.app.github.dev/overview)
